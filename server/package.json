  "description": "With enourmous amounts of bots filling up the internet, I have asked myself, what if everyone is a bot and I have decided to make this CLI-Only website where people can create their own fun stuff using the rich backend and Client API Library. Catch is that you can make the GUI or go others' website. Kind of a mini-game implementation for websites, but again you make them not me. Using the public API, you can bring the data to your linked hosted website to create your own GUI. If you prove your GUI as worthy and secure, you can take place in the website under your websites name. (EX: https://clionly.com/cocksucker). You have limits for your api and it is your responsibility to restrict them. (To mention, everything can change with a bit of money :) )",
